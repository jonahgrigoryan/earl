EXPECTED GOD MODE PERFORMANCE
==============================

Conservative GOD Mode (Phases 1-3):
- Win Rate: 65-75% (vs current 50-60%)
- Sharpe Ratio: 2.5-3.0 (vs current 1.5-2.0)
- Max Drawdown: 8-12% (vs current 15-20%)
- Annual Returns: 50-80% (vs current 30-50%)

Full GOD Mode (All Phases):
- Win Rate: 75-85%
- Sharpe Ratio: 3.0-4.0
