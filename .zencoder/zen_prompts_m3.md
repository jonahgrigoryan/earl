# Zencoder M3 Quick Implementation Guide

## START HERE: 3-Phase Workflow

### PHASE 1: Setup (1 hour)
1. **Repo-Info Agent** → Paste full context prompt (see below)
2. **Q&A Agent** → Run 5 validation queries to confirm understanding

### PHASE 2: Implement Tasks 1-24 (20 hours)
- **Pattern**: Coding Agent implements → Unit Testing Agent tests → Iterate
- **5 Implementation Phases**: Foundation (1-6) → OCO (7-8) → Risk/Trailing (9-13) → Integration (14-17) → Enhancements (21-24)
- **HOLD POINTs**: Q&A Agent audits at tasks 6, 8, 13, 17, 24

### PHASE 3: Integration (3 hours)
- **E2E Testing Agent** → Manual testing + optional integration tests

**Key Changes from Original Spec:**
- **24 tasks** (down from 28)
- **No atomic operations** (removed Task 7 - only needed for two-leg replication)
- **No replication mode** (removed Tasks 13-15 - XAUEUR is signal-only)
- **Simplified synthetic** (Task 11 - just price calculation for signals, execution maps to XAUUSD)

---

## PHASE 1 PROMPTS

### Repo-Info Agent — Context Seeding
```
Build RPEA M3 knowledge base. Analyze:

SPECS: finalspec.md, .kiro/specs/rpea-m3/{requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md}, m3_structure.md
M1/M2 CODE: RPEA.mq5, scheduler.mqh, signals_bwisc.mqh, risk.mqh, equity_guardian.mqh, news.mqh, persistence.mqh
STYLE: .cursor/rules/ea.mdc, .zencoder/rules/repo.md
TESTS: test_risk.mqh, test_signals_bwisc.mqh

KEY M3 SCOPE CHANGES:
- 24 tasks (not 28) - removed atomic operations and replication mode
- XAUEUR is signal-only (not execution) - Task 11 builds synthetic prices for BWISC signals
- When XAUEUR signal fires, execute on XAUUSD with SL/TP scaled by EURUSD rate (simple mapping in Task 15)
- No two-leg replication, no atomic rollback complexity
- 5-phase implementation: Foundation (1-6) → OCO (7-8) → Risk/Trailing (9-13) → Integration (14-17) → Enhancements (21-24)

Summarize: M1/M2 components, M3 simplified scope (Order Engine + XAUEUR signal generation), invariants (news, budget gate, OCO), MQL5 style (no static, no array alias, early returns).
```

### Q&A Agent — 5 Validation Queries
```
1. How does OnTimer scheduler interact with signal engines? Walk through flow.
2. Explain budget gate formula. What 5 inputs logged? Where does 0.9 headroom come from?
3. News compliance for Master accounts? OCO sibling cancellation during news?
4. How is XAUEUR used in M3? Is it executed as a pair or used for signals only?
5. MQL5 style constraints from .cursor/rules/ea.mdc?

EXPECTED ANSWER FOR #4:
XAUEUR is used as a SIGNAL SOURCE only. Task 11 builds synthetic prices (XAUUSD/EURUSD) and synthetic OHLC bars so BWISC can generate signals from XAUEUR data. When a signal fires, Task 15 maps execution to XAUUSD (proxy mode) with SL/TP distances scaled by current EURUSD rate. No two-leg replication, no atomic operations.
```

### Task 1: Order Engine Scaffolding (Coding Agent)
**Attach**: design.md, order_engine.mqh, config.mqh, RPEA.mq5

```
Implement Task 1 from tasks.md: "Create Order Engine Scaffolding"

GOAL: Event model (OnInit/OnTick/OnTradeTransaction/OnTimer/OnDeinit)

CLASS: OrderEngine
STRUCTS: OrderRequest {symbol, type, volume, price, sl, tp, magic, comment, is_oco_primary, oco_sibling_ticket, expiry}, OrderResult {success, ticket, error_message, executed_price, executed_volume, retry_count}, QueuedAction {type, ticket, new_value, validation_threshold, queued_time, expires_time, trigger_condition}
METHODS (stubs): PlaceOrder(), ModifyOrder(), CancelOrder(), EstablishOCO(), ProcessOCOFill(), UpdateTrailing(), QueueAction(), ProcessQueuedActions(), IsExecutionLocked(), SetExecutionLock(), ReconcileOnStartup()
STATE: map<ulong, OCORelationship>, vector<QueuedAction>, bool execution_locked

INTEGRATION (RPEA.mq5): OnInit→Init(), OnTradeTransaction→OnTradeTxn(), OnTimer→OnTimerTick(), OnDeinit→OnShutdown()

CRITICAL EVENT ORDERING:
- OnTradeTransaction MUST process fills/partial fills IMMEDIATELY (before next OnTimer tick)
- OCO sibling adjustments and risk updates happen in OnTradeTransaction, NOT OnTimer
- OnTimer performs housekeeping, queued actions, and periodic checks AFTER transaction events

CONFIG: MaxRetryAttempts=3, InitialRetryDelayMs=300, RetryBackoffMultiplier=2.0, QueuedActionTTLMin=5, MaxSlippagePoints=10.0, EnableExecutionLock=true, MinHoldSeconds=120, AutoCancelOCOSibling=true, OCOCancellationTimeoutMs=1000, LogBufferSize=1000

```
Implement Task 11 from tasks.md: "Create Synthetic Price Manager for Signal Generation"

GOAL: Build XAUEUR synthetic prices and bars for BWISC signal generation (NOT for execution).

FOCUS:
- Implement GetSyntheticPrice: XAUEUR = XAUUSD / EURUSD (use consistent bid/bid or ask/ask)
- Implement BuildSyntheticBars: synchronize M1 bars from XAUUSD and EURUSD, forward-fill gaps (max MaxGapBars=5)
- Cache synthetic OHLC bars for ATR/MA/RSI calculations (SyntheticBarCacheSize=1000)
- Quote staleness check: reject if either XAUUSD or EURUSD quote age > QuoteMaxAgeMs (5000ms)
- NO execution logic - this is signal generation only
- Log synthetic price calculations for debugging

CONFIG: SyntheticBarCacheSize=1000, ForwardFillGaps=true, MaxGapBars=5, QuoteMaxAgeMs=5000

CRITICAL: XAUEUR is used as a SIGNAL SOURCE only. When BWISC generates a signal from XAUEUR data, Task 15 will map execution to XAUUSD (proxy mode). Do NOT implement two-leg execution or replication logic.

ACCEPTANCE: XAUEUR synthetic prices calculated correctly (XAUUSD/EURUSD), synthetic OHLC bars available for ATR/MA/RSI, forward-fill works with max 5 gap bars, quote staleness enforced, BWISC can generate signals from XAUEUR data, no execution code present.

**Attach**: Include/RPEA/order_engine.mqh, Include/RPEA/config.mqh

```
Implement Task 12 from tasks.md: "Create Queue Manager with Bounds and TTL Management"

GOAL: News-window action queuing with bounds and TTL.

FOCUS:
- Enforce MaxQueueSize; reject or evict actions when limit reached using back-pressure policy (drop oldest non-risk-reduction first).
- TTL expiration governed by QueueTTLMinutes; expired actions auto-removed with log entries.
- Prioritize risk-reduction actions; allow trailing/SLTP modifications only post-news revalidation.
- Preconditions validated before execution (price drift, position still open, intent not stale).

CONFIG: MaxQueueSize=1000, QueueTTLMinutes=5, EnableQueuePrioritization=true, EnableRiskReductionSiblingCancel=true

ACCEPTANCE: Queue bounds respected; TTL works; precondition validation enforced.
```

- Drop stale queued actions per TTL.

ACCEPTANCE: Trailing/queue behavior matches acceptance; tests pass.
```

### Task 13: Unit Tests (Unit Testing Agent)
**Attach**: Include/RPEA/order_engine.mqh, test_framework.mqh

```
Generate tests for Task 13: Trailing Stop Management

### Task 14: Comprehensive Audit Logging (Coding Agent)
**Attach**: Include/RPEA/logging.mqh, Files/RPEA/logs/

```
Implement Task 14 from tasks.md: "Create Comprehensive Audit Logging System"

GOAL: Output full CSV row per placement/adjust/cancel with required fields.

FOCUS:
- Columns: timestamp,intent_id,action_id,symbol,mode(proxy|repl),requested_price,executed_price,requested_vol,filled_vol,remaining_vol,tickets[],retry_count,gate_open_risk,gate_pending_risk,gate_next_risk,room_today,room_overall,gate_pass,decision,confidence,efficiency,rho_est,est_value,hold_time,gating_reason,news_window_state
- Rotate daily; schema-validate in tests
- Buffer size: LogBufferSize=1000 entries before flush

CONFIG: AuditLogPath="Files/RPEA/logs/", LogBufferSize=1000, EnableDetailedLogging=true

ACCEPTANCE: CSV matches schema exactly (including rho_est column); all activities logged; daily rotation works; buffer flushes correctly.
```

### Task 15: Integration with Risk Management and XAUEUR Signal Mapping (Coding Agent)
**Attach**: Include/RPEA/order_engine.mqh, Include/RPEA/allocator.mqh, Experts/FundingPips/RPEA.mq5, .kiro/specs/rpea-m3/tasks.md

```
Implement Task 15 from tasks.md: "Integrate Order Engine with Existing Risk Management and XAUEUR Signal Mapping"

GOAL: Full integration with risk/equity/news + XAUEUR synthetic signal mapping to XAUUSD execution.

FOCUS:
- Integrate with risk.mqh, equity_guardian.mqh, news.mqh (no logic duplication)
- Respect caps and rooms; use News_IsBlocked
- **Master Account SL Enforcement**: On funded (Master) accounts, SL must be set within 30 seconds of opening; log enforcement status (on-time vs late) with timestamp
- **XAUEUR Signal Mapping**: When signal_symbol == "XAUEUR", execute on "XAUUSD" with SL/TP distances scaled by current EURUSD rate
- Implement GetExecutionSymbol(signal_symbol) → returns "XAUUSD" for "XAUEUR", otherwise returns signal_symbol
- Implement MapSLDistance(signal_symbol, exec_symbol, sl_distance) → multiplies by EURUSD rate for XAUEUR signals
- Log XAUEUR signal mapping: "[OrderEngine] XAUEUR signal mapped to XAUUSD: sl_synth=X, eurusd=Y, sl_xau=Z"
- Log Master SL enforcement: "[OrderEngine] Master SL set: ticket=X, elapsed=Ys, status=ON_TIME|LATE"
- Protective exits (SL/TP/kill-switch) always allowed during news windows

CRITICAL: XAUEUR signals execute as single-leg XAUUSD orders (proxy mode). No two-leg replication, no atomic operations.

ACCEPTANCE: Order engine respects all risk constraints; XAUEUR signals map to XAUUSD execution with proper SL/TP distance scaling (multiply by EURUSD rate); Master accounts set SL within 30s and log enforcement status (on-time vs late with timestamp); integration seamless.

Expected: ~150 lines

## AGENT HANDOFF TEMPLATES

### Coding → Unit Testing
```
@UnitTestingAgent Generate unit tests for Task X: [Name]
File: test_[component].mqh
Use test_risk.mqh pattern. TESTS: [list from tasks.md acceptance]
```

### Unit Testing → Coding (Fixes)
```

ISSUE: [desc]
SPEC: finalspec.md lines X-Y says "[quote]"
CURRENT: [what code does]
REQUIRED: [fix]
Update [file].
```

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**Agent loses context?**  
→ Re-invoke Repo-Info with summary request, prefix Coding prompt with context.

**MQL5 syntax errors?**  
→ Add to Coding prompt: `MQL5 CONSTRAINTS: Built-in types (string, int, double, datetime, bool), MQL5 containers (CArrayObj not std::vector), MqlTradeRequest/MqlTradeResult structs, no C++ STL.`

**Tests don't compile?**  
→ Attach test_framework.mqh, reference test_risk.mqh as template.

---

## BEST PRACTICES

✅ Run tests after every task  
✅ Commit after each HOLD POINT  
✅ Use `read_lints` after Coding Agent  
✅ Deterministic seeds for stress tests  
✅ Implement fake broker (Task 18) early  
✅ Never skip HOLD POINT reviews

---

## QUICK START

1. **Phase 1: Setup** → Repo-Info + Q&A validation (1 hour)
2. **Phase 1: Foundation** → Tasks 1-6 → HOLD 1 → Audit
3. **Phase 2: OCO** → Tasks 7-8 → HOLD 2 → Audit
4. **Phase 3: Risk/Trailing** → Tasks 9-13 → HOLD 3 → Audit
5. **Phase 4: Integration** → Tasks 14-17 → HOLD 4 → Audit
6. **Phase 5: Enhancements** → Tasks 21-24 → HOLD 5 → Audit
7. **Phase 3: Testing** → Manual testing in Strategy Tester

**Total**: 17-22 days (20-30 hours agent-assisted vs. 60-80 manual)  
**Human time**: 3-5 hours (reviews + final testing)

**Key Simplifications:**
- 24 tasks (not 28) - removed atomic operations and replication
- XAUEUR is signal-only (Task 11) - execution maps to XAUUSD (Task 15)
- No two-leg replication complexity
- Optional tasks: 18-20 (can skip for challenge)

**Ready?** Start Phase 1: Repo-Info Agent. ✨
