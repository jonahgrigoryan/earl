Cursor Prompt: Generate RPEA M1 Project Skeleton (Structure-Only)

Goal
- Create the exact MetaTrader 5 (MQL5) project structure and placeholder files for the RPEA M1 skeleton.
- Structure only. Do NOT implement any code logic. Zencoder will implement functionality later.

Context (read from repo)
- finalspec.md (authoritative requirements)
- prd.md (product context)
- rpea_structure.txt (authoritative file/folder layout)
- README.md (setup and CSV schemas)

Strict Constraints
- Create the file/folder tree under MQL5/ exactly as specified below.
- Generate empty files (or header-guard-only for .mqh). For .mq5, include a top-of-file comment banner only (no functions).
- Create .gitkeep in empty runtime folders so the skeleton is preserved in git.
- Provide `{}` in JSON files and a header-only CSV file as noted.
- Do NOT write any trading/order code, functions, or includes. No stubs beyond header guards.

Target Tree (must match exactly)

File Templates
- RPEA.mq5: Only this banner, nothing else:
  // RPEA.mq5 — M1 skeleton entry file (structure-only)
  // No functions or trading/order APIs in this phase.

- All .mqh files: header guards only, for example:
  #ifndef RPEA_CONFIG_MQH
  #define RPEA_CONFIG_MQH
  // Intentionally left blank — implemented in later milestones.
  #endif

- JSON files: write {}
- CSV file: write a single header line: timestamp,impact,countries,symbols

Deliverables
- Create the tree and files exactly as listed.
- Return a concise summary of created paths.

Do/Don’t Recap
- Do: exact paths, header guards, .gitkeep for empty dirs, JSON/CSV headers.
- Don’t: no functions, no includes, no trading/order code, no logic.

Definition of Done
- 41 files present (including .gitkeep and data headers) matching the above.
- No code implementations beyond header guards and comment banner.
- No trading/order-related APIs present anywhere.
